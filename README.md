End-goal: Have a guessing game that fetches a random Zillow listing and have the user guess the price dependent on the images and where it's located

<p>This project involves multiple components of webscraping to fetch zillow data</p>

<p>My code:</p>
<p>          main.py - fetches a random zipcode and uses a submodule python file (zillow.py) to return a dataframe full of listings</p>		
<p>          randomZipcode.py - Searches the provided excel spreadsheet of the 30,000+ zipcodes and returns a random one</p>
<p>Referenced code:</p>
<p>	     zillow.py - URL: https://github.com/maxwellbade/zillow_scrape_python - edited to fit my needs, this file is used to take in a random zipcode and return a dataframe (max 40) of listings</p>


I will be working on this project when I can, would like to get this done and make it a fun game 8)
